A Rag Tag bunch of SQL scripts

In 2012, a crack procedure unit was sent to a repository by a company for a git they didn't commit. These procedures promptly escaped from a maximum security database to the Minnesota underground. Today, still wanted by the company they survive as stored procedures of fortune. If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them....maybe you can hire The A-Team.
